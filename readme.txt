This is a native Card Game made by me (ph0enix) just for fun.

Rules:
(i) Exactly 4 players are needed to play this game.
(ii) Its name is also known as "pabi".
(iii) Game starts with the player having Ace of Spades.
(iv) That guy has to throw Ace of Spades on the table and rest three can throw any card of any suit.
(v) Guy having Ace of Spades has the turn now. So he will try to throw a card having minimu value. Here vslues in increasing order are:
2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,Jack,Queen,King,Ace.
(vi) After that next player will have the turn.And he will throw the card.But if next to next doesn't have the card of same suit then he will throw the card having maximum value of any suit and the cards on the deck will go to the player having maximum value of card.
(vi) So, In this game, the one with left at the end having cards loses.

In this game NO ONE WINS, only there is only one loser.

** How to run the code:
(i) Create a project in netbeans or eclipse.
(ii) Copy Server.java,Client.java, and images folder in src of the project.
(iii) Change the ip address from 127.0.0.1 to your ip address i Client.java.
(iv) Note that four laptops are needed as it is played on lan.
(v) Every laptop should have Client.java and the images folder in their project.
(vi) First one laptop will run Server.java.
(vii) Then each of diferent laptops will run Client.java.
(viii) Now an Applet with images of cards in ot should appear on four laptops.

Have Fun!!!!
